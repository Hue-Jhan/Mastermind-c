# Mastermind-c
Mastermind game in C (University project), built in Eclipse (our teacher forced us to use this crappy compiler, and also prohibited us from using switch, for, break, and other statements. We also had a limit of returns to use in a function, and had to handle variables, data and globals in a specific way...

# ðŸ•¹ Game
The game is quite simple: a random string of X integers is generated and u have to guess it; you insert a possible combination, if its correct u win, if its not the game will tell you the exact number of integers in the correct position and in a wrong position. You have Y attempts, if u lose u can see the correct combination, and u can also save the game and resume it whenever u want (as long as the data path works xd).

Simple terminal interface (in italian), you can manage the settings to edit the difficulty of the game and other stuff like nÂ° of attempts, nÂ° of integers generated, etc. 
The menu gives u 4 options:
- Check out the rules of the game;
-
